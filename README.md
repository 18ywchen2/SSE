# SSE

Cross-Project Defect Prediction via Semantic and Syntactic Encoding

## About

This repository contains the implementation of the SSE (Semantic and Syntactic Encoding) approach for Cross-Project Defect Prediction. The project utilizes advanced techniques to integrate semantic and syntactic information from codebases to improve defect prediction models.

## Requirements

SSE is executed on Linux (ideally Ubuntu 22.04.3).

## Prerequisites & Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/18ywchen2/SSE.git
cd SSE

* pip

    In your virtual environment, run:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    to install the required packages.

## Usage
preprocessing
Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data:
```
python preprocessing.py
```
Running the Application
To start the defect prediction process, execute:
```
python run.py
```
